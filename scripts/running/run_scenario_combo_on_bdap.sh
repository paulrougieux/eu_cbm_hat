# The purpose of this script is to run the given scenario combination on JRC's BDAP cluster

# It is better to keep as much of the logic as possible in python. But there
# are some steps such as starting the conda environment and moving to the
# relevant directory that are better done at the bash shell. If possible to
# move this to python and to parallelise then this is a future improvement that
# is worth pursuing.
#
# Usage: - make a symbolic link to this script in the home directory for ease
# of use.
#
#       ln -s $HOME/eu_cbm/eu_cbm_hat/scripts/running/run_scenario_combo_on_bdap.sh $HOME/run.sh
#
# - Call it
#
#       ./run.sh pikssp2
#
# - Transfer to the shared directory
#
#     rsync -zav $HOME/eu_cbm/eu_cbm_data/output_agg /eos/jeodpp/data/projects/SUSBIOM-TRADE/transfer/eu_cbm_data
