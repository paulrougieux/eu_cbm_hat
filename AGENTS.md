## Project Overview

This package models carbon fluxes in European forests using pandas data frames. The
project focuses on biophysical modelling of forest ecosystems. This is a **data science
project** focused on economic and biophysical modeling applications.

## Code Style and Standards

- Limit lines to 88 characters
- **Primary format**: NumPy Style docstrings
- **Type hints**: Required for all functions and methods
- **Comments**: Explain the scientific rationale, not just the implementation
- Include references to relevant literature and standards where applicable

## Communication Style

When generating code or documentation:

1. **Explain rationale**: Why this approach over alternatives?
2. **Provide context**: How does this fit in forest carbon cycle science?
3. **Reference standards**: Link to established methods and conventions
4. **Balance theory and practice**: Scientific rigor with computational efficiency
5. **Think reproducibly**: Code should be self-documenting and verifiable
